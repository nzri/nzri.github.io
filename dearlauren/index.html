    <!-- Salutation -->
    <div id="dear"><p>Dear Lauren,</p></div>
    
    <!-- 1st Paragraph -->
    <p>It’s been a while. I wanted to gather my thoughts and write a small letter to you, but knowing me it probably won’t be small at all. I’ve never written anything like this before because nobody has ever mattered to me as much as you do. I hope you set a bit of time aside and read it because I put my heart and soul into it.</p>
    
    <!-- 2nd Paragraph -->
    <p>It really stung and hurt me when you’ve said that I’m a stalker, a creeper, and a weirdo overall. It’s heartbreaking you were convinced that I’m that type of person and I didn’t think I will be able to prove you otherwise. I never wanted to hurt you and I had no ill intent towards you when we were friends or partners. I can’t fathom how you can think of me this way when you know me better than anyone else, and when at one point we’ve been the closest to each other. You’ve seen me at my peak and you loved it more than anything else. It changed over time because we both messed up, but I took it much further, burned more bridges, and turned into a person that you wanted to get rid of. A few of our mutual friends turned their back on me as well, and I can only assume it’s because you’ve talked to them about me. I’m not accusing you of anything; I want to show you my perspective too. It still feels surreal that the person that’s been the closest to me would think of me that way, but this letter is about something else.</p>
    
    <!-- 3rd Paragraph -->
    <p>I’m an idiot and I really fucked up. I got so close to the person that matters to me the most and I single-handedly ruined everything we had, to the point where you were scared of me and later on you told me off. I wanted to say that I am sorry for everything I’ve done. I’m sorry I’ve been such a burden and a child. I’m sorry for the broken promises and that I didn’t treat you right. I’m sorry for no longer being the person that you fell in love with and that you always wanted to be around with. I regret all the things we wanted and planned on doing together but never got the chance, and that includes us talking too. We both had issues with communication, but what makes me feel worse is that you’ve waited for months for me to start talking, yet I’ve been nothing but an impatient idiot with you. I feel like everything would be much easier had we talked, and our relationship would progress instead of snowballing all the way down. I doubt we would argue at all since it’s all easily solvable with voice and it’s much easier to understand how someone feels like when they talk. I’m sorry I kept aggressively pushing you to communicate instead of giving you time and helping you with it like a normal boyfriend would. I found a screenshot from late October with you saying "tomorrow we will talk, no more delay" in a sweet way, which means I’ve been delaying that for a very long time. I was never rejecting you; it was a mental block that I couldn’t break through for the longest time. The last time we played and finally talked is one of the fondest memories I have. I’ve always wanted to do more with you, but it felt like our relationship was going nowhere and it’s why we haven’t even seen each other’s picture. I feel really bad I made you wait for so long that eventually you lost all interest in it and moved on to talk to other people.</p>
    
    <!-- 4th Paragraph -->
    <p>I’ve missed you so much, Lauren. And I really missed being close to you. It hurts being away from you, but I don’t think you feel the same way. I was immature before and didn’t fully understand what it’s like, to take care of my partner and make her happy. I sincerely regret how I treated you in our relationship. I was a child with abandonment anxiety that was overwhelmed with feelings and emotions. I was overprotective and extremely scared that I would lose you, especially when it came down to spending time with others. I was scared that someone might make you happier and it was only hurting our relationship. I’ve been told a lot of people make the same mistake in their first relationship, but that does not excuse what I had become. You felt burdened by my jealousy and annoyingness and eventually it’s what made you leave. What I mean by "jealousy" is that when you would get excited about interacting with other people or play with them, I would feel fear that you would leave me for someone who might make you happier. Sometimes when people say "jealousy" they are talking about behaviors like telling their partner not to go out, or restricting who they can talk to, but that is not something I did. In fact, I explicitly told you that I wanted you to keep doing all of those things, both for your own happiness and because it was kind of like exposure therapy for me: the more I see you doing things that make me feel jealous but don’t lead to you betraying me, the less they’ll bother me.</p>

    <!-- 5th Paragraph -->
    <p>It was the best I could think to do under the circumstances, and I was deeply in love with you to the point that I committed my heart and soul to it, but it still wasn’t enough. Something didn’t click and you hid from me that you spend time with others. Ever since you left me, I’ve spent a great deal of my time terrified that you’re getting romantically involved with someone else, and I can’t chalk that feeling up to insecurity because it’s reasonable to assume that you would be now. Sometimes I would wake up in the middle of the night from nightmares about you getting rid of me and getting involved with a new partner. Sometimes I cry spontaneously when I’m home by myself, which is something I never did before. I never wanted to tell you how badly I’m suffering, mostly because I’ve heard from other people who said their exes laid on truly terrible guilt trips in an attempt to keep them around, and that’s exactly the opposite of what I want. I want you back as my exclusive romantic partner and happy to have me around as a positive addition to your life, partly because then I wouldn’t be so terrified all the time, partly because that would restore my faith in other people, and partly because I genuinely miss you as an individual. I don’t want you to grudgingly, miserably tolerate my presence in your life because that would not be good for either of us. I really needed a mental reset and a break from everything.</p>
    
    <!-- 6th Paragraph -->
    <p>I’ve made a really big effort over the past few weeks to be less tense or anxious and it has dramatically improved my life. You’ve told me that traits online can be retained to how one acts in their everyday life, so in order for you to consider anything I would have to change how I act online first. It’s not a one time thing; it’s a continuous process that will probably never stop and I will work on myself even further. I think you’ll definitely notice and appreciate the change if you accept me in your life again. During this period of time, I’ve adjusted my behavior to avoid making the same mistakes. I’m able to view disagreements from the other side’s perspective. I don’t have the need to just say something even if I don’t have anything good or important to add. I won’t just immediately go for the jugular and try to belittle someone I love; I will really listen to you and think about what I want to say first. I consider the impact of my actions on other people and I understand when is an appropriate time to talk about certain topics instead of making someone uncomfortable. I support others and help them find strength to support themselves. I give people space and time when they need it, which is something I wasn’t able to do before. I remain calm under pressure; things and actions that made me anxious at that time now make me proud and happy for you. I feel so much more relaxed going through each day. I let the idiots be idiots and I didn’t get worked up over it. The only thing that kept me going was the hope that you will let me make you happy once again. Only time will tell if you will ever change your mind after seeing how I am, unless you’ve already found someone else.</p>
    
    <!-- 7th Paragraph -->
    <p>I promised I would never leave you sometime around when we met, when you’ve said that every person in your life has been the same and eventually they hurt and left you. For the past two years I’ve been looking forward to each day because you brought happiness and enjoyment to my life. Back then, you were my motivation and the reason I got high rank in season two. I met a lot of new people and became sort of known in that top 1% community, but I never forgot about you and still spent a lot of time with you. I don’t remember if I’ve ever told you this, but one time Dogman asked me if I could sub for one person and scrim with their team. It was an open opportunity for me because potentially I could’ve played competitively and make it somewhere big, like I’ve always dreamed about. But I declined the offer at that time because you wanted to spend some time with me. When we played together, I’ve always tried to push you to your limits because I saw the potential even when we first met. You’ve introduced me to more people during that and it’s why I made a lot of friends. And now you proved yourself: lots of people know you, you’ve met and made a ton of friends, and you’ve shown how good of a player you really are. I’ve heard different people mentioning you in my ranked games a couple of times and I also saw you stream since I’ve been following your channel for a while now. If you still care about my opinion, then know that I am proud of you. I remember when you wanted me to promise that if I become friends with more people I won’t forget about you; I asked you to promise me the same, to which you said you won’t forget and you don’t want to in the first place. The tables have turned now and you made it out there. But it seems like you are slowly forgetting about me like nothing between us happened or ever really mattered.</p>

    <!-- 8th Paragraph -->
    <p>I don’t want to be forgotten, not by you at least. I don’t want to lose everything we built together over the past few years. I want to try again with you because I know that I have fixed myself and I’m a normal person now. I think there’s still a part of you that hopes to get our romance back, a part of you that misses it and wants to try again. But there is also that part of you that’s so jaded and done, that doesn’t want to try anymore because you’re scared I will go back to how I was before. I’ve always told you I would change when we had our little fights and I did for a bit, but then it was back to the jealousy and fights. One year ago, you were also very uncomfortable with me and wanted to get rid of me, but you gave me a chance to prove myself, which made you fall in love with me. I think I will be able to show you that I’m not the person that I made you think I am; I was distressed before and acted vastly different, which I’m remorseful for. I was blinded by my own selfishness and ignorance; it wasn’t until you left I realized what I had become and how it was affecting you. I could tell by your actions that you still loved me after you broke up with me, but I’ve been a nagging pain and annoyed you so much that you wanted me to go. I want to show you that I’m in the right state of mind now; it feels like a lightning storm in my head has finally come to an end. I hope you did not forget about me and you won’t be apathetic. The more I write about this, the more I realize that I had the same mindset back then, which made you the happiest little person. Of course there’s been a lot of ups and downs, but we’ve always come to terms with our differences because relationship like this only comes once in a lifetime.</p>
    
    <!-- 9th Paragraph -->
    There was a game presented at E3 this month, called <em>Unravel 2</em> ironically enough. It’s a game about two little creatures made out of yarn that are connected to each other with a string, working together throughout the entire game. It caught my eye because I thought it could be applied to us when one of the developers talked about the game.
    <div id="quote1">
      - "In <em>Unravel</em>, we used yarn to symbolize love and bonds between people. In our new game we tear that bond up right at the start. You lose everything, including your spark. When things are at the darkest, you find hope. And you form a new bond. And your spark is rekindled. And it leads you off on an adventure."
    </div>
    <div id="quote2">
      - "It’s a game about fresh start and second chances. These two little souls refuse to give up, and they build something new and beautiful together. And the whole game is inspired by that spirit of optimism and togetherness. You see, it’s all made to be played with two characters. You can play it alone or you can play it in co-op with a friend, but there’s always two characters there, sharing one yarn and working together to get through this adventure."
    </div>
    
    <!-- 10th Paragraph -->
    <p>Life is a one time thing and finding the right person is one of the most important things in it. I don’t want to give up with you and I want to go through this adventure with you. We’ve been through hell of a lot of things and we always stuck together. I still remember how it all started and how much we felt for each other at that time. You were really scared I would leave you when you told me your age and I will never forget how emotional you were. I remember how you were the first to tell me that you like me and how I asked you out. We’ve never really had real love before, not until we met each other. We weren’t just an internet couple that got together for the sake of e-dating; we’ve been a real couple that could genuinely relate to each other and loved each other unconditionally. Prior to this, we went through a year of different emotions that led to us developing strong feelings for each other. We’re very similar and always found same things fun and interesting. We had goals and plans for the future, and we were even saving up to meet each other as soon as we could. We’ve been a "we" couple and if you remember, it felt surreal for both of us every time we said "I love you" to each other. We were so genuine and happy with each other that we wanted to be together for the rest of our days. It made me very happy that you’ve opened up to me since you were very closed-off and secretive before. You used to ask me to stay up and talk before we went to sleep. We were excited to talk to each other every day when we woke up and my heart raced a small bit with every discord notification. I was waiting every time to message you whenever I would get the chance, even sometimes during class. We’ve had so many heartfelt conversations that made us both feel warm inside and looking back at it, it makes me cry.</p>
    
    <!-- 11th Paragraph -->
    <p>You’ve seen how wholesome and full of love Saebyeolbe and his wife are, and I want to be like that with you, Lauren. I’m not aiming for a few months of another unhealthy relationship; I want to be in a genuine and honest relationship with you that will last until the end of our days. I want to be a part of your family and I want to be with you. I want to meet your mom and dad and show them that I’m mature, but also fun to be around. It will probably take me some time to get comfortable around them, but I will make it work. I want to meet the little Toby too; I love and miss the dog. I want you to be comfortable enough around me to be yourself and I want to make you laugh and smile every day again. I want to add happiness to your life and do the little things that will make you feel better if you’re having a bad day. There is nothing that we <em>have to</em> do and I don’t want you to feel pressured or restricted. You don’t have to spend all your time with me and I want you to have as much time to yourself as you need. I want to be like other guys in a relationship that solo queue all day until their girlfriend wants to spend some time together. I don’t want to neglect any friends, mine or yours, and I’m open to make new ones and spend time with other people too. I want to get out of my bubble and grow with you, in every sense of the word. I want to be always positive, supportive, and encouraging you to do more things. I want our relationship to be sweet and wholesome like it was at the beginning. I want to meet up one day and go on a real date with you. If I will get another chance, I will do everything to treat you with love, care, and respect.</p>
    
    <!-- 12th Paragraph -->
    <p>I’ve always cared about your happiness and success, and I still do. It was always my priority and goal to make you happy, which in turn made me very happy too. I’ve always wanted to keep up with your well-being and ask how you feel about things, but I couldn’t do that often because of my behavior. Even after my change, I still wanted to try and make you happy every day, but I failed every time and I couldn’t figure out why. I used to insult myself a lot before because I really didn’t like myself, until one time when I called myself an idiot you told me that I am not one in your eyes. I can’t show it well through text, but you’ve had a great impact on my life and me in general. You brought the color to the gray depressive world inside my mind, and the taste to my everyday food that had no taste prior. You were the summer thunderstorm in my drought of blazing sunshine days; your rain and lightshow made me feel alive in ways I never had before. You’ve always found a way to make my dark days brighter and I had something to look forward to every day. You made me laugh and smile so much; I really appreciated and adored that about you. You made me like myself and you were able to suppress my anxiety and depression, which is something nobody could ever do before. Even though we’ve had a lot of arguments, you made the last two years the happiest in my life. You were the only person I was fully comfortable with. You’ve changed my life and how I think. I think it was the same for you, at least in the beginning. I never intended on hurting you; even back then you asked me if I would ever take advantage of you because you’re younger and weaker, to which I replied I never will. It only made me want to protect and take good care of you since you’re so small and precious. I put you before everyone and treated you how I always wanted to for the first two-three months, but then I started acting up. I did not display my best emotional self at first, and for that I am genuinely sorry.</p>
    
    <!-- 13th Paragraph -->
    <p>I’ve fixed myself and came back to ask your hand again. Almost exactly one year later, I’m sending you another message in hopes of you revising your decision. I’ve never taken so much time off in order to get my head in the right place and then come back to see if I still have a chance of rebuilding our relationship. I’ve had so many missed opportunities in the past to show you that I became a better person, but I struggled and failed every time, which I deeply regret. I was an idiot that didn’t understand much, but I’ve learned from my mistakes and now I understand a lot of things. Given my progress and improvement, I think I will be able to demonstrate my maturity and change, although I still would like to spend time with you in a relaxed way because I want to have fun too. I don’t want to bring up negative things from the past, so let’s only remember the positive ones. I want to relive all the happy memories with you again, and I want you to realize that I really did mature. I want to impress you with the change and rebuild our hearts and minds again. I think you will be proud of me just like I was proud of you improving your communication back when we were together. I still have some flaws and issues because I’m a person too, but they aren’t as major as what they once used to be. One thing you can be sure of, I will not repeat my previous mistakes, including how I acted in the past.</p>
    
    <!-- 14th Paragraph -->
    <p>The only thing that’s left to do now, apart from continuing to grow as a person, is to ask you something that still means a lot to me. I don’t think you still think of me that way, but I will try it one more time, hoping that you do. I’ve waited almost all my life for the right person and ultimately gave up on it because I wanted an emotional connection with someone I can genuinely relate to and spend time with, not just sex or whatever else. I could never find such a person in my life, no matter what I did or where I went to. Until by accident I met you, Lauren. After everything we went through in our own lives, we met each other just by chance and liked each other ever since. I hope it’s not too late and you still see me in your life. I would like to continue where we left off, before you started distancing yourself from me. I want to treat you right, like the little princess that you are. I want to be together and live a happy life with you. If you let me, I’ll be the person you once loved and the boyfriend that I know I can be.</p>
    
    <!-- Final Paragraph -->
    <p>Lauren, given the improvement and my change, will you reconsider your decision and give me another shot?</p>
