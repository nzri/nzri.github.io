        <h1>About me:</h1>
       I'm an average Bellevue College student that is working towards a Computer Science degree.<br>
        There is nothing much else to say about me. I don't have any hobbies, homework keeps me busy, and I like to spend time with my girlfriend whenever I get the chance to do so.
